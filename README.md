# GERP
A modified Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) pipeline for the analysis of genetic load in wildlife species

The original version of GERP++ is available here: https://github.com/tvkent/GERPplusplus

To facilitate the analysis of genetic load, we provide a script to automate input file production called 'Pipeline_input_alignment_GERP.sh', as well as a modified version of GERP++ which creates more user-friendly outputs and streamlines the extraction of sites of interest from a VCF file as known derived alleles using three outgroup species, a ste which can be completed using an R script we provide called 'Derived_alleles_extract.R'.

The protocol outlining the extact steps involved and how to do them is also included.
